Although not very North American in basis, it is a good story and pulls the reader in very quickly in spite of the length of the manuscript.

The lawyer is a former college hockey star with a strong intellect and expensive tastes. He obsessively visits the graves of famous historical figures and finds he will have to make increasingly unwelcome visits to more graves to get to the bottom of what turns out to be a bigger mystery than he had bargained for. Along the way, he falls in love with the murder victim\\\'s widow while still grieving over his recent divorce. He finds himself in physical confrontations in which he relies on his weapon of choice, a sawed-off hockey stick. He has to call on the friendship of his ex-wife and of a law partner fond of reading and quoting Clausewitz\\\'s On War. He discovers that the secrets he is trying to expose may threaten not only powerful people but the province\\\'s founding myths. While set as a mystery, this is definitely not a police procedural and it could be read more as a fable than as a detective story. The facts behind the mystery open up to themes of friendship, love, the inescapability of grief, the weight of history and the nature of truth.\\\"\r\n\r\nThe author is Alberta political reporter (and NeWest author) Mark Lisac writing under a pseudonym.','N'),(247,273,6,NULL,'N','2014-02-10 10:19:42','2014-04-30','Nothing To Hide',NULL,'fiction','From the author\\\'s cover letter: \\\"Set in a screwed-up version of contemporary Vancouver; in a post-epidemic city where society is hell-bent against disease, where health is policed and unhealthy behaviour is a crime, where people are under total surveillance, Nothing to Hide follows a few months in the life of all around average guy William Potenco, movie buff, social network freak, hard worker; and explores just what the demands of normality are under a regime so addicted to defining all difference as an indication of sickness.

His many accomplishments include being a founding member of both the Canadian Mountain Guide Association and Canadian Avalanche Association, as well as a member of the first Canadian ascent of Mount Logan.

She flies to Cairo, a world as foreign to her as an alien planet, with no idea that the events of the next 23 days will prove transformative not only for her but for Egypt itself.\r\nFrom the moment she steps from the plane, Fernâs equilibrium is under assault. She is overwhelmed by Cairoâs chaotic mix of sights, sounds and scents. Bittersweet memories surface unexpectedly. Disquieting dreams disturb her sleep. Increasingly unsettled, she befriends Naomi, a spirited fellow Canadian. As they explore Cairo, the strangeness that initially intimidates Fern begins to intrigue and ultimately seduces her.

When by chance, he meets Violet Limmeridge, wealthy heiress to Billingham Manor who tells him about her auntâs unsolved murder, Jonathon seizes the opportunity to make a name for himself as an investigative journalist by taking on the case. He wants to prove to himself and to the rest of Goosedown that heâs not the worthless idiot his ex-wife believes him to be. And unlike others, Jonathon is prepared to go to bizarre lengths to get to the bottom of the case, often landing himself in trouble: digging an underground tunnel into his doctorâs surgery in order to avoid the âcrazed and menopausalâ secretary is not off the cards for Jonathon Sparrow. On the surface, Goosedown appears to be a picturesque and quaint village, but Jonathon soon finds out that its residents have a darker and more sinister history. He learns that Violetâs mother, Ethelreda was severely disturbed as child or -as others described her- âpossessed by devilâ and it is Jonathon who discovers that Ethelreda was later murdered by her father because she became pregnant with Violet out of wedlock.  When Jonathon makes a breakthrough in the case and uncovers that Violet had a secret twin sister, Lily âwho was adopted by a widower at birth- he realizes that heâs just unearthed another heir to the Billingham fortune and therefore another possible suspect with a definite motive.\\\" Author calls the book \\\"the secret love child of P.G.

In these chatty chronicles of a multi-generational family, there is sufficient local interest to have kept me reading (if also occasionally skimming through the second half) to the end on page 166. The account of the Ross family\\\'s relocation from Baddeck Nova Scotia to Edmonton by way of Banff, of William Ross\\\' business dealings with Alexander Rutherford, Alberta\\\'s first Premier, and the relationship between the Ross and Rutherford daughters, kept my attention despite a surfeit of descriptive detail that too often descends into a celebration of the trivial. There is considerable detail regarding the early history, businesses, and residents of Strathcona (aka \\\"Southside\\\"), but which nonetheless adds little to what might otherwise be gleaned from old city directories. While some of the author\\\'s reminiscences of childhood pastimes and mischievous pranks are mildly amusing, the overall tone, and disjointed digressions, make for somewhat painful reading. And the second half of the book gives a whole new dimension of meaning to \\\"triviality.\\\" An intensely personal collection of reminiscences that some readers might find heartwarming, I found more conducive to \\\"heartburn\\\".

Clara Blackstone, a young wife, travels up to Durham City to meet her husband, Henry, a newly appointed Professor of Mathematics at Durham University. It is supposed to be a fresh start - a chance to put recent troubles and nightmarish events behind her. But after a tense reunion, their carriage runs into a mob gathered to witness the (real life*) mass murderer Mary Ann Cotton being brought into Durham Jail. Buried memories of Claraâs second tragic miscarriage begin to resurface, and her inability to recall the circumstances surrounding her subsequent committal to an asylum, cause her to question her husbandâs motives for placing her there.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara befriends Catherine, an outspoken Suffragist, she joins her as a prison visitor, working with female inmates. Clara encounters Mrs. Cotton and becomes increasingly fascinated with her story, and when she learns the murderer is pregnant the obsession grows. As she follows the sensational newspaper coverage of the case and the heated discussions among Henryâs colleagues, the idea that one can be born âunnaturalâ takes root in her mind.\r\n\r\nWith Catherineâs help she eventually finds the courage to remember the terrible events of her miscarriage and the role her husband Henry played in locking her away. Soon Clara is fighting for her sanity, her freedom and her grandmotherâs inheritance while the public outrage grows about Mrs. Cotton, a woman who would go against her God-given instincts and murder her own children and several husbands by poisoning, a âwomanâs choiceâ of weapon.

Intrepid pilgrims with little taste for living in tents and panning icy riverbeds saw opportunity instead in the nearby Chilcotin prairie, pre-empting land to provide the steaks, roasts and pan fried calf livers to feed the thousands scurrying northward with glittery eyed yearning. Prosperity seemed assured. Until the gold dried up and beef prices fell off the edge of the world. With a suddenness more chilling than the blizzard of panic it triggered, calamity appeared inevitable. One man, though, dreamed an alternative. English architect-turned-cowboy, Norman Lee, proposed to mount a cattle drive from his ranch in the Chilcotin to the newly discovered Klondike in the Yukon, where beef was rarer than an honest card game.  It was a journey of over fifteen hundred miles, a distance greater than Canada to Mexico, over trails negotiated much of the year by dogsled. There was little graze and almost no habitation.

Myth and imagination hold equal weight, authenticity and fable go hand-in-hand, and the lines between reality and illusion blur. The stories reveal the plight of outsiders to readers in a way that make them feel part of the inner circle. Characters find themselves trapped, or at least, incapable of restoring their humanity. Underlying their failures is a tacit suggestion that perhaps they could have won out with more imagination, more strength, or simply with some encouragement. It may be sobering to observe such forays into darkness but it canât be all gloom from an author who can make you laugh uproariously while tugging at your heart strings.\"','N'),(492,512,1,NULL,'Y','2016-01-19 12:02:56','2016-01-19','My Russian Girl',NULL,'Literary Fiction','From the author of SNEAKER WAVE, which was shortlisted for a national fiction award (ReLit), and a Western author. \r\n\r\nAs per the author\'s email: \"This 99,000-word novel explores the delusive life of Nicole, one of an estimated 20,000 foreign nationals who each year become entrapped as human smuggling victims in Canada and the United States.\"','N'),(493,513,1,NULL,'Y','2016-01-19 14:57:26','2016-01-19','Darwin\'s Moving',NULL,'non-fiction','Author is a journalist and furniture mover located in Calgary, and this book discusses the odd act of going into peoples\' houses and moving their stuff around.  Per the author: \"My book offers the reader two views into the moving industry.  One shows the job itself, the technical, labour-intensive and challenging work we encounter on a daily basis.  Yes, it does take strength to lift a glass china hutch; but to move it through narrow doorways, up spiral staircases, over pristine hardwood, watching for height and balance and steps and obstacles while supporting one end of an awkward 500-pound pieceâ this takes grace, agility, concentration and a very specialized sort of strength not developed in the gym.  I have moved desks through second-storey windows and lifted 1200-pound hot tubs over backyard fences.  Movers handle tasks like this regularly, and we often make it up as we go along.\r\n\r\nThe second (and more important) focus of the book is the human\r\nnarrative.  Many of my colleagues are guilty of terrible, cruel or\r\nreckless actions, but they nevertheless show themselves to be kind and considerate not only with customers but also each other.  I have known some of them for years, and this dissonance has always struck me as fascinating.  In a similar vein, there are inescapable elements of classism in the industry.  Movers are generally drawn from the working poor, employed but lacking financial security.  We are invited into some of the finest homes built for some of the wealthiest people inCalgary.  Working alongside violent criminals, drug abusers and a neo-Nazi, I have moved CEOs, executives, professional athletes and local celebrities.\"','N'),(494,514,1,NULL,'Y','2016-01-19 15:06:21','2016-01-19','The Chillest Land',NULL,'literary fiction','Author has previously published with Ronsdale Press, Oolichan Books and Borealis Press.

The point of view is that of a sixty-year-old research psychologist, who has retired from her work in Montreal and returned to her home near Kelowna. Her extended family is complex and fraught, and through her reacquaintance with their lives she revisits her troubled past.  The history and landscape of the Okanagan are skillfully revealed through her ruminations on the changes wrought by the passage of time â the environmental depredation of âdevelopmentâ and colonization, and the necessity of adjusting to inevitable changes in a positive way. The protagonist resembles Hagar from Lawrenceâs The Stone Angel in her emotional inhibitions and critical assessments of others, and there are perhaps too many allusions to this novel, but Sidonie grows on the reader as she gradually learns how to be more generous and forgiving of herself and others. The early death of her older sister, Alice, provides some mystery and suspense (as well as an ironic and oblique reference to Alice in Wonderland). \r\nThe novel could be tightened with the excision of some repetitious elements â the many descriptions and memories of Alice, for example, the protagonistâs constant agonizing over whether she should have returned, and whether she has done the right thing in raising her orphaned niece and baby. Although each family member has his or her own story, these rarely detract from the primary narrative arc, and usually inform the growing awareness of the protagonist. The ending is tantalizingly ambivalent.\r\nI highly recommend publication. \r\n'),(48,29,36,2,2,1,'2012-07-15','2012-07-11',NULL,'This collection of stories is a daunting read. The prose is dense and intense, always striving for effect. Metaphor may be imaginative, but also hyperbolic; e.g âthe despondent dance of coloured fishâ in the first story, entitled âWhite.â Also in the first story, the use of a backslash to juxtapose images seems affected; e.g. âbeer bottle/fish killer.â The tone is similar in most, a detached, dry voice, which may alienate the reader. Death is a recurrent subject â the various ways in which families deal with loss, and there is little humour or irony to provide respite. In âBeautiful Morningâ two ethnically disparate punk artist-lovers swim to their deaths in the Hudson River, in a state of despair over their lost relationship. The prose in âFourteenâ is more spare, but the characters reduced to âthe boyâ and âthe manâ, and the boyâs hope that the Sobeyâs lobster he sells will become a pet is difficult to credit.  In âCourting the Borderline,â a promising young athlete succumbs to drugs, despite the desperate hope of his single mother. âThis is a Love Crimeâ portrays a fraught marriage, in which the possessive husband sells his wifeâs dog in revenge for her infidelity. Dogs recur in the stories, usually in improbable roles, and with tragic ends. \r\nTwo of Kvernâs works have been published by Brindle and Glass: Afterall (2005) and The Matter of Sylvie (2010), and several of the stories in this collection have received awards.

Over the course of the novel, Edith slowly finds enough strength within herself to cultivate a backyard garden, despite objections from Vivian and Wilf, to take a job in a nearby shop, and eventually to learn the truth behind her motherâs death and her fatherâs irrational hatred for Edward Black next door.\r\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the first third of the novel, in which the gloominess of Edithâs life, Wilfâs insane behaviour (I havenât even mentioned his never-ending re-wallpapering of the living room), and Vivianâs sheer imperious awfulness, combine to create juicy moments of nearly Gothic black comedy. \r\n\r\nThe middle stretch of the book, which focuses on Edithâs growing skills as a gardener and her developing friendships with various postmen and shopkeepers, feels like it could be cut down somewhat to improve the bookâs pacing. Edithâs many benefactors all tend to have the same sort of kindly, half-pitying relationship with her, which creates a certain amount of repetitiveness in the narrative. Perhaps Chard could prune some of those scenes down, and use this part of the book to sow a few more tantalizing clues regarding the mystery of Edward Black? It feels to me like this section of the book could use a little more tensionâmaybe a stronger sense of the possibly dark consequences of Edithâs growing independence? Perhaps we also need a stronger sense of why Edith doesnât try harder to learn what lies on the other side of that wall, and why her father despises Edward Black. \r\n\r\nAll that said, this is an involving read, a portrait of a young woman finding small freedoms within stifling environs. The payoff in the final section, with the discovery of the mirror garden in the Black backyard, is especially lovely, and worth the lengthy buildup throughout the rest of the book. \r\n\r\nThe story has no connection whatsoever to Western Canadaâdonât know if thatâs a problem.\r\n\r\nI would suggest changing the titleâperhaps something related to flowers or gardens and which conveys the gloomy, paranoid mood of much of the story. Perhaps a quote from one of the classic poems that Edith loves so muchâespecially one by Emily Dickinson, whose social isolation recalls Edithâs? The Fainting Bee? To Blush Unseen? Elysium? Eden Lips?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of those poems, the book contains 15 or so short quotes from classic poetry, almost all of it in the public domain. (There is one quote from William Carlos Williams that may still be under copyright, and one from Jane Kenyon.) Chard provides footnotes for these quotes within the text, an approach I found distracting. Perhaps instead we could include an appendix at the back of the book listing the sources of these various passages for the benefit of curious readers.\r\n'),(66,30,56,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-07-30',NULL,NULL),(67,24,76,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-13',NULL,NULL),(68,33,69,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-17',NULL,NULL),(69,33,68,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-17',NULL,NULL),(70,35,74,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-17',NULL,NULL),(71,24,5,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-08-19',NULL,NULL),(73,89,80,1,3,1,'2012-10-22','2012-09-06',NULL,'A lackadasically paced story, written for a masculine audience.

There is little connection to the âWestâ in theme, setting, or author location. Marguerite Pigeon has published poetry and stories and has an MFA from UBC (2004). There is no corresponding story to the title, which is rather discouraging in its implications.

Subtle insights lurk beneath the surface, although the style in the last few stories becomes increasingly impoverished, with a tone of reportage. \r\nI recommend a third reader.

I\\\'m just frustrated, and bored maybe, too. Nothing is terribly wrong, but nothing is right, either. It\\\'s just this dissatisfying in between.

The plays are fast-moving, funny, youthful, and clearly the product of an engaged, imaginative theatrical mind.\r\n\r\nThe strongest play in the collection is MOVING ALONG, a monologue consisting of short, autobiographical-seeming vignettes that are part confessional, part stand-up comedy. There\\\'s not, strictly speaking, a narrative throughline here, but together the vignettes add up to a compelling portrait of a young man struggling admirably to rise above his own character flaws and bad decisions (along with a hearty helping of parental fucked-upped-ness) to become a good person. The vignettes are remarkably consistent, thoughtful, honest, and often inspired in their humour. The original stage production of the play involved Craddock sitting in a chair rigged with lights that he could control with switches in the armrests, enabling him to do amazingly precise scene-changes and character-switches. That innovative element, obviously, cannot be recreated in a book, but the play (like all of these scripts) reads very smoothly and conversationally on the page. Craddock\\\'s earnestness and smarty-pants sense of humour stay in perfect balance throughout.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SPEAKING and PORN STAR, the other plays in the collection, are both wild yarns that require a single performer to assume several different characters. PUBLIC SPEAKING is, to my mind, the more successful of the twoâit\\\'s about a self-help guru whose philosophy that one should only act out of complete self-interest is put to the test when his sex-addicted, estranged daughter is kidnapped by a drug dealer. The story is a little outlandish (the most unusual character is a simple-minded, soft-hearted giant who gets roped into assisting with the kidnapping), but the parallel themes of addiction and self-interest that are threaded interestingly through the script.\r\n\r\nPORN STAR, meanwhile, is the most outright comic of the three playsâit\\\'s the story of a mild-mannered small-town librarian who unexpectedly finds herself nominated for \\\"Best Amateur Video\\\" at a porn-industry awards ceremony. The fish-out-of-water comedy that ensues is fairly amusing; it\\\'s hard to know, though, what to make of the scenes involving the librarian\\\'s kid sister, who is now in Hell, having killed herself a year or so earlier. The weakest part of the play are the scenes involving the librarian\\\'s mother, a high-profile political operator determined to get Sarah Palin elected president; the characterization of this woman as a completely horrible, mindless homophobe came off as a pretty lazy caricature to me. \r\n\r\nStill, PORN STAR seems to be a favourite of young theatre artists across Canada (I believe there have been two or three different Fringe productions of the script in the last eight years), and Craddock has performed both MOVING ALONG and PUBLIC SPEAKING in many cities as well. Craddock has a solid profile both locally and nationally (most recently as a cast member of co-creator of the TV series TINY PLASTIC MEN), and this collection would make a good companion to NAKED AT SCHOOL. NAKED AT SCHOOL has turned out to be a solid moneymaker thanks to its success at high school drama departments; the more adult content of this collection would probably preclude it from succeeding in the same way. \r\n\r\nStill, this is a strong, very entertaining group of plays from a writer with a fresh, confident, creative voice.

This is a funny, touching, narratively unusual and over-the-top novel, where readers will be both appalled by the protagonist at the same time as they\\\'re charmed by her antics and life experiences.\r\n\r\nBeginning with her mother\\\'s death, the protagonist must navigate her remaining relationships with her teenage daughter, her live-in boyfriend, her ex-husband, and her (soon to be past) boss. Within these fairly standard relationship scenarios, the novel undercuts readers\\\' expectations by presenting a narrator who refuses sympathy for the main character (in many ways, this stance conveys the protagonist denying compassion to herself), through an oblique telling voice and through intriguing anti-narratives, such as lists, choose-your-own-adventures, career admonishments, etc.\r\n\r\nThe novel specifically undercuts its own \\\"plot\\\" by embedding these non-linear lists and \\\"facts\\\" throughout the manuscript.

Somehow, this protagonist is both gnarly AND sympathetic! The manuscript displays a vigour and thoroughness that challenges readers\\\' ideas about what a novel can do, especially in terms of who tells the story they are reading. Adams\\\' writing is sure, sophisticated, polished, and engaging. The joy of this novel is an off-kilter, off-blaance, off-her-game protagonist, who seemingly messes every emotional relationship in her life. But as the narrative progresses, readers come to understand that every decision the protagonist makes is in some way a direct reaction to her mother\\\'s death. What comes off at first as kooky disorganization is in fact a sophisticated portrayal of grief. Funny, disastrous, and terrifically awful. I adore this story!\r\n\r\nI do think the novel could be expanded a bit .My one major rewrite request: the manuscript does an excellent job of conveying the protagonist\\\'s frustrations with sister, ex-husband, current boyfriend, daughter, and boss. I want to see this close circle of emotional connections expanded by one character: namely, the not-so-best best friend.

Even though it is light-hearted and humourous, it still addresses several serious life events, such as the death of a loved one, familial conflict, job loss, divorce, single-parenthood, and teen pregnancy. Despite the seriousness of some of the subject matter, the authorâs method of presenting these issues still made me laugh out loud at several scenes, and many of the scenes are incredibly believable, even though a few of the scenarios are not.\r\n\r\nHowever, there a few points that I would recommend be changed. First, the protagonistâs mother is said to have died of ovarian cancer, which typically has a rapid growth rate-âin fact, it is one of the deadliest cancers because of its growth rate, which makes early detection nearly impossible. However, the mother is described as having had her tumour, named âHerby,â for many yearsâin fact, there is even a reference to her having developed it when the main character was pregnant, a highly unlikely scenario, as the child with which she was pregnant is now a teenager. Second, I found pages 118-125 confusing at times, especially the scene in which the protagonistâs daughter, ex-husband, and his fiancÃ©e are interacting. Kateâs actions (fetching water) and her reaction to her fatherâs toast seem a bit contrived, and the scene is difficult to visualize (although the burst of activity followed by the sudden stillness is effective overall, I think). Third, the way everything is neatly wrapped up at the end seems rushed and disingenuous (page 124). At the end of it all, itâs difficult to believe that Kate, Jerry, and Ben would be so naÃ¯ve and easily led. Other readers, however, may not agree.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the story is smart, sassy, and entertaining, and some of the scenes are brilliant.

Shellbomb is competent and crisp, but it reads like the first novel of a guy with chops but still finding his way into fiction.  Most scenes are quite well realized.  Most of the characters come across with adequate particularity. The central action is, if anything, over-explained against a political context. This is a novel about anxious Canadians in Sri Lanka, facing up differently to Tamil resistance against Sinhalese state authority, neither of them able, ultimately, to be of any help. \r\n\r\nThe book probably needs a careful go-over for continuity.  It starts off feeling like itâs going to be ripping yarn boy-fiction.  It ends up affiliating itself to Heart of Darkness.

The narrator is an old man who has survived multiple atrocities as a child and a young man. He addresses his recollections to a childhood friend, Antoine. âAmong the shadesâ alludes to Antoineâs death, but also to a line from Wordsworthâs âOde to Immortality,â an elegy to lost youth and innocence.

He is ostracized by his community, and condemned by his daughter, who has naÃ¯ve left-wing views. \r\nThe memoir begins graphically with a Cossack raid on a Mennonite village, one of many horrors in the account, and moves back and forward in time, with multiple characters who remain largely undeveloped, and anecdotes that are placed like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In an article on the paucity of Canadaâs historical fiction (SCL 1989), Wiens has characterized the postmodern historical novel as subverting privileged accounts of history, a speculative treatment of historical facts. In To Antoine, received notions of Jewish pogroms, Mennonite alignment with the Germans, and even the moral implications of numbers of civilian bombing victims are challenged by the experiences of one individual who survived against all the odds. The narrative begins to lose credibility, however, as the atrocities mount up, and the narratorâs (and authorâs?) agenda becomes more evident â Did he know about the concentration camps, and to what extent was he responsible?  Was Hitler worse than Stalin? Who suffered the most? The casualties before and during WWII are enumerated: the Ukraine and Belarus lost half of their population, and civilian losses from bombing were highest in Japan and Germany.

Although Coutureâs voice is not as masterful as that of Eden Robinson, there are many similarities between the two and a comparison is apt.  Coutureâs stories offer a kind of double-vision, as relationships and situations find ready parallels which may offer the reader more insight than the characters.  For example, in âThe Rabbit,â Sue realizes in the end that, in addition to being the pacesetter for the marathon, she is the pacesetter for her own marriage. \r\n\r\nOverall, the writing is excellent.  Coutureâs phrasing is often delightfully quirky: the sunâs âhallelujah raysâ (97), the little brother who âsticks closer than a blackberry stainâ (152), etc., etc.  Aside from copy-editing, I would like to see this writer â who has a real talent for colourful phrasing â use such phrasing in order to do more to differentiate the voices of his various narrators and characters.

There are striking insights into family relationships; e.g., âParenting is like working on a jigsaw puzzle for years only to realize youâre missing all the important pieces.â Given the bleakness of the prevailing scenario, the conclusion is perhaps too sentimental and contrived, fulfilling an underlying quest to find a home.  \r\n \r\n'),(171,30,189,1,3,2,'2013-10-26','2013-09-26',NULL,'I recommend this manuscript for possible publication.\r\n\r\nIn the 1930s, the Sulphur Springs resort was Ontario\\\'s answer to taking the waters at Bath.

The first chapter involves the narrator arriving at university, feeling like a country mouse, out of place in his new big-city surroundings, but also hoping that he will somehow be able to reinvent himself, accumulate a bunch of cool friends, and somehow get laid. But the rest of the novel turns out to be an extended recollection of his youth in Happen and his friendships with a pair of male classmates. The book\\\'s recurring theme is the narrator\\\'s relationship with God and religionâhis distant, churchgoing father constantly tries to inspire religious feeling in him, couching all his fatherly advice in Bible verses, but the narrator, despite being good-hearted, remains unmoved by church and thoughts of God. The small-town setting and the focus on the narrator\\\'s relationship with his childhood friend Ken, who grows up to be a big, musclebound, somewhat antisocial bruiser who in the novel\\\'s climax commits a shocking act of violence, makes the book read a little like Lynn Coady\\\'s THE ANTAGONIST, only told from the point of view of the writer and not the writer\\\'s seemingly thuggish friend.\r\n\r\nBut Nichols\\\' story doesn\\\'t have the momentum or the vivid details that made Coady\\\'s book so compelling. There\\\'s a rambling quality to the storytellingâindeed, when I was halfway through the book, I was still unsure what the story was supposed to be. The childhood anecdotes and the details of life in Happen seemed arbitrarily chosen, not building towards something larger. Perhaps the problem is the lack of urgency in the voice of the narrator, who describes all these incidents with a kind of a shrug.\r\n\r\nAll that said, the book does come together in the final third.

After a catastrophic decision he made involving taking a risk with company money, he was summoned back to Calgary and became the kind of guy who looks forward to collecting his retirement money and doing what the company wants. He never contacts Phyllis again and when he is sent to be a temporary manager of the PD Beijing office, he meets herâshe still works thereâand is overwhelmed by guilt and contriteness by his callow and selfish behaviour.\r\nBob finds his cojones little by little as he goes against company directives to investigate Bobâs death, and he becomes aware that once again he has to think for himself when it comes to the high-stakes world of oil exploration, and redeeming the name of a decent and hard-working old friend.\r\n\r\nThe end is not what I expected.\r\n\r\nI was engaged the whole way and recommend publishing. \r\n'),(219,195,192,2,3,1,'2013-12-10','2013-10-28',NULL,'This manuscript is a challenge to evaluate at a time when NeWest wants to revisit its mandate. The Offset Man is a page-turning, good (with some reservations) oil-patch mystery. Its literary values are not high, but it is relatively compelling. Ultimately, I do not think that we should publish it without a clearer sense of our mandate. Alongside the Gary Ryan novels, NeWest would quickly become a mystery novel publisher if we add books such as this one to our list. I would like us to move in more avowedly literary directions. But I want it sent to another reader for confirmation of my views.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the manuscript itself, there are several things that I would request in revisions. First, the character Richard is completely unbelievable -- no speaks like that, or, if they did, no one would tolerate them for even a moment, no matter their cultural power. He is a mindless bully as currently portrayed, without a whiff of being sympathetic. He needs to be thoroughly rethought. Second, the degree of technical detail about oil drilling is a bit much for a non-specialist reader like this one; I would advocate some simplification on that front. Third, Charlie\\\'s actions do not quite make sense, especially as the novel concludes. For someone who has obsequiously been a \\\"yes man\\\" for all these years to suddenly -- and needlessly, for the plot could be adjusted so that he does not sabotage himself -- make so many obvious errors rings false. Also, it\\\'s abundantly clear from the very first meeting with April that she is Charlie\\\'s daughter. Why Charlie would think otherwise is mystifying and / or poorly handled. Either that plot element needs rethinking, or the relationship between Charlie and Phyllis needs to have been more furtive, \\\"seedy,\\\" or momentary in the past; Charlie could be one of her many lovers, or similar -- but the current set-up is too obvious.\r\n\r\nThose are my main concerns. As I say, I would not advocate publication because of the impact to the NeWest list overall; in my view, it isn\\\'t a great fit.

The story is told in a series of brief, efficiently told vignettes. The manuscript is short (the author\\\'s cover letter says it\\\'s about 39,000 words), but there\\\'s not much that I would suggest he add--the brief length of the book is the result of economic storytelling, not a failure to fully flesh out the world of the story. The book is very humorous, especially in the main character\\\'s dealings with annoying customers, but always stays grounded in reality. The writing is simple and spare and confident, and the main character is flawed but likeable--I was rooting for him all the way through, and Trinder does a good job of convincing you that the character is as good a writer as the other characters say he is.\r\n\r\nMinor quibbles: the father\\\'s transformation at the end of the book from a bitter asshole to a supportive dad is a little abrupt. The decision to set the book in late 2001/early 2002, with numerous references to September 11, is interesting, but I would have liked to have seen it pay off somehow at the end. The book could be sold as a YA title--although the profanity, casual alcohol and drug use, and references to sex with underage girls might restrict it to older teens and adults. Matt and I asked LPG about the title; the expletive would create some marketing challenges.

Many of the disturbing premises here (for example, the âbeautiful bodyâ who offers â to those who desire him â his unconscious body for a set period of time) reminds me of the performance art of Marina Abramovic. Clearly, notions of risk, vulnerability, yearning, and emotional exposure figure strongly in these intriguing stories.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I do see a need for quite a bit of editing throughout all the stories in this collection. I remember Suzette saying that Crisp needed a great deal of heavy edits, as well, so Iâm confident that the author will be open and amenable to extensive comments and feedback.\r\n\r\nMuch of the manuscript is imbued with easy clichÃ©s to get a point across, when what the narrative needs is strong, fresh language to match the subject matter. For example, in the very first story, âBlink,â twice the narrator uses the metaphor of searching âblindly,â and often resorts to bland description (such as when the narrator explains he has a âhollow feeling in his gutâ), rather than foregrounding an inventive and charged language.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in other stories, we often get a âtellingâ rather than âshowingâ language. Such as in âSinaiâ when the narrator says that a character âlooks angryâ and the woman he sees in the desert stands âstill as stone.â There are many examples in many stories, but I neednât go on. I do think we should accept this manuscript (especially as it is a collection of short stories, a form Iâm particularly fond of), and Iâm willing to be the editor, if the press would like.\r\n\r\nIâve read this electronic version very quickly, to get back to the press quickly, so apologies for a rather truncated report!\r\n'),(224,195,196,2,2,3,'2013-11-14','2013-10-28',NULL,'I found this manuscript to be pretty slight.

I was reading this MS looking particularly for what might be compelling in it or what is it that demands that it be published, and found little to that end. Of course, we\\\'re likely to be lampooned in the author\\\'s subsequent writing -- there are pieces here based upon publishers\\\' rejections of (presumably the author\\\'s) work -- so I would also recommend brevity in the letter back.'),(225,38,206,1,3,2,'2013-12-03','2013-11-08',NULL,'This manuscript strikes me as a perfect addition to NeWest\\\'s line of mysteries.

The supporting cast of characters is well-drawn, and there are a few nice little subplots involving the narrator\\\'s flirtation with a local veterinarian and her somewhat strained relationship with the aunt who raised her as a teenager. The author has hinted that she would like to write more books featuring this main character, and I like the idea of a crime-solving actress... seems like that idea would present lots of opportunities for interesting, ever-changing settings as the actress goes from job to job, film shoots to stage shows of varying sizes and in various cities.\r\n\r\nBasically what I\\\'m saying is, this strikes me as one of the strongest mystery manuscripts I\\\'ve seen since my arrival at NeWest (with the possible exception of BUSINESS AS USUAL).

The manuscript needs serious editing at the sentence level, and contains far too many erroneous and confusing details.\r\n\r\nAlthough it could be a very good book one day, in its present form I question whether or not it is suitable for publication by NeWest Press.  The story has a very strong regional focus â on places other than the Canadian west â but this is not even my primary reservation.  The story is told in a way which requires a deep knowledge of the Bible which should not be presumed unless the book were to be published by a Christian press.  Further, the text includes several sections with detailed analysis of key Biblical passages which do little to advance the story.

The first two thirds of the stories contained in DEATH CLOUD could almost be read as a very eccentrically-structured novel, as they collect a series of incidents, rivalries and love affairs surrounding the inhabitants of a particular office building in Calgary. The building itself is surrounded by something called a \\\"death cloud\\\", which seems to allow spirits to live there after death, and can only be seen by certain people. A few of the main characters (Matt, Jagadeep) cannot see what is so different about the place, but others can tell that ghosts and other spirits haunt the building.\r\n\r\nI quite liked the character of Nate the Ghost, and I was intrigued by the flashbacks to how he died in the stories \\\"June the Two\\\" and \\\"Eaten by Wolves\\\". The process by which he becomes a ghost is very intentionally left ambiguous, apart from the fact that we know he was killed by wolves. As a ghost he is a very entertainingly unsympathetic character, and I enjoyed how much the author committed to his dickish behaviour. I also liked the love triangle between Matt, Sarah and Beth, with Matt being torn between two very different, yet equally death-obsessed women. The sequence where the sex-on-the-brain Jagadeep plays around with ideas of language as he avoids doing anything at work was entertaining (\\\"Language and Other Horrors\\\"), and I found the initial story of how Beth believes she can breathe underwater fairly moving (\\\"I have learned to breathe underwater\\\").\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed the emails and \\\"Action Item\\\" lists from Jackson, the office\\\'s overly boisterous manager, who may in fact be turning into a wendigo if he is the main character of \\\"The Brentwood Wendigo\\\" (again, this is ambiguous). All in all, the characters in the stories reminded me of the ones found in Andrew Kaufman\\\'s ALL MY FRIENDS ARE SUPERHEROES, 20-30 year olds with special abilities rendered in a very lo-fi style to the reader. The sarcastic, bitchy dialogue recalled Douglas Coupland, especially GENERATION X. I initially enjoyed how in some stories the omniscient third person narrator would comment on the events on display, but by the end of \\\"June the Two\\\" especially I was a little tired of the device.  \r\n\r\nThe last third of the book moves away from the office and its inhabitants to focus on other people who encounter death in their everyday lives.

Of these, I liked \\\"No One Said Anything about the Grey Tie\\\" and \\\"Transfer\\\" the best.\r\n\r\nI feel as if DEATH CLOUD might be an interesting, youthful and witty addition to the NeWest family of short fiction titles, a sort of masculine analogue to LOVE AT LAST SIGHT (yes, I realize the contradiction inherent in that statement, given the latter\\\'s themes). It recalls that book\\\'s structure, with a collection short stories revolving around similar ideas paired with a longer narrative, in LOVE\\\'s case the novella \\\"To The Dogs\\\". The problem, though, is that I fear this book would not work unless an editor was very, very intrigued by it. It would need quite a bit of structural work to make the transitions between the \\\"Death Cloud\\\" cycle and the \\\"Other Stories\\\" less jarring to the reader, and I personally would also want a little bit more detail on how the death cloud works, and a little bit more resolution on the many dangling plot threads.'),(229,24,203,3,3,1,'2013-12-02','2013-11-28',NULL,'Although I kinda enjoy obscenities like the title, after finishing this ms, I feel it does the novel a disservice, for while the narrator spends a lot of time showing us how stupid most \\\'asshole\\\' customers at the gas-station where he works are, he also slowly fills us in on how he just may be able to change his loser life. and that\\\'s the real story here.

Some of the stories take on interesting challenges, such as \\\"June the Two,\\\" which not only presents a first-person-plural narrator, but also offers most of the dialogue in \\\"script\\\" form. The problem is that I don\\\'t see how these strategies work much pas the \\\"device\\\" stage--WHY is the narrator a plural entity? How does the dramatic form extend the fiction of dialogue and conversational interplay?\r\n\r\nThe dialogue often relies on a representation of reality that conveys a \\\"flat\\\" tone.

A fully rounded narrator who admits his complicity and knowledge deficiency could be quite interesting, but at the moment, it reads merely as a narrative maneuver. I found the two strongest stories (interestingly, two of the only three stories in this collection written in first-person singular) to be \\\"The Brentwood Wendigo,\\\" though it, too, ended abruptly and without achieving its own narrative aims, and \\\"transfer\\\" about ambulance workers who transfer dead bodies (and it too ends on a steady \\\"no-emotions-just-ongoing-life-stuff\\\" note).'),(232,30,203,2,4,1,'2014-02-01','2013-12-11',NULL,'This is a fairly compact manuscript about Brendan, a twenty-year-old who is ready to make a change from his dead-end job.

In a final attempt to escape the situation in which he finds himself, the early-twentysomething Foley makes the quick decision to move to Morocco and teach English rather than stay in school for film studies.

Foley has lived through some traumatic experiences, and uses photos to document his journey. I felt that this aspect of the narrative had limited value, as he also feels the need to insert photos of trading cards, Osama bin Laden and other relevant political figures.

The narrator tells the story through the eyes of several different people, primarily middle-aged Ken, but also his wife, and, to a lesser extent, his 19-year-old son. Oddly enough, the title character, Sandia, is the one whose perspective we never really see, even though the entire story is centred around her, or at least on peopleâs fantasies built around her.\r\n\r\nThere isnât a single character in this manuscript whose perspective we do see who has any redeeming qualities. I didnât find any of them truly relatable: even though there are moments when each is genuinely reaching for honestyâand presumably to do what he or she considers rightâthose moments are few and far between, each punctuated with horribly selfish and sometimes incomprehensible acts, such as drug running, violence, and sexual assault. Ken, the main character, seems to see himself as a nice guy, even as he runs drugs, fires a gun at a stranger, sexually assaults the teenaged Sandia, and forces his wifeâs grandfather into a home so he can assume ownership of his property. He justifies all in his head as being necessary or accidental, and we see him scoff at his co-drug runner Cam, who openly talks about raping Sandia, as if he were superior to Cam, even though the reader can see otherwise. Similarly, Kenâs son, Cary, also sexually assaults Sandia, convincing himself that she wants it. Kenâs wife, Siobhan, who does not assault or rape Sandia, still objectifies her and then uses her in many different ways to live out her own fantasies, sexual and otherwise. Even Kenâs daughter, Helen, most conspicuous by her absence (since her post-secondary schooling decision is the catalyst for all the action), is portrayed as selfish, as she could go to a Canadian university on a full scholarship, but she insists on attending Julliard, expecting her parents to pay for it. Nearly every character we meet in this manuscript, including friends of Ken and Siobhan, is incapable of seeing beyond his or her own desires, which leads to a manuscript rife with racism, sexism, violence, and, predictably, problematic relationships.\r\n\r\nThis isnât necessarily a bad thing: even though I can acknowledge that I prefer to be able to relate to a character, or at least root for one, I realize that some readers donât find this necessary. However, what was problematic for me was my lack of a sense of how purposeful the depiction of these characters was: it wasnât clear to me whether or not I should want to sympathize with any of them. And there were times I couldnât tell if a scene was supposed to be humorous or dramatic. The moments of black humour could have been better presented as suchâperhaps one reason why this might work better as a film than a novel.\r\n\r\nI also found the lack of coherence and continuity (mostly due to setting) to be problematic. The story jumped from location to location a bit too casually, as if the reader is supposed to accept that the shifts from the dangerous bush to the coffee shop to the orchard to the aqua yoga studio really happen that seamlessly for the characters. I couldnât find any willing suspension of disbelief in the strange range of settings and the moves between them. \r\n\r\nHowever, although this was not a fun novel to read, it would be an interesting novel to teach for the very reasons mentioned above (the odd perspectives, the charactersâ lack of self-awareness, the difference between what the reader sees and what the characters see, etc.). Also, as I previously mentioned, if the black humour were emphasized, it could also be an interesting film.\r\n\r\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about this manuscript, but I think there could be something to work with here. Even though I found the characters mostly awful despite their normal outward appearance, this makes them interesting. Although I found myself wishing the title character had been developed, I understand why that probably wouldnât have worked in the manuscript (along with the dangers of appropriation of voice). Iâm sure passing it along to another reader will give you a better sense of whether or not it is a potential candidate for publication.'),(264,33,237,1,3,1,'2014-04-04','2014-03-10',NULL,'These are well-written, but not amazing stories. Many rely on the âfantasticâ to grab a readerâs attention, without paying attention to the language that must accompany such unusual characters and narratives. For example, the first story, âCase Sensitive,â is about the âperfectâ woman (blond, big boobs, works for a beer company, wears skimpy clothes when her husbandâs friends come over for poker night) who finds out sheâs a robot. She revolts mildly, and story ends with her working as an accountant. Itâs cute and sometimes projects a pretty funny feminist take on this well-worn scenario, but Iâd never be interested in reading this story a second time â itâs a one-joke wonder. The collection works best when a story is written in a weird and yet cunningly realistic way (such as the story of the male stripper in purgatory), but the stories about Irish faeries (as in the title piece) or the âsponsoringâ parents of the âgeniusâ in âYour Best Interestsâ mostly read as a storyteller trying too hard to compel readers forward.\r\n\r\nA lot of the stories seem as if theyâre mostly summary (such as in âDire Consequences,â when weâre told that the boy tests the mother but then reverts to his obedient ways), until we get to the âcrux,â but need to focus on every part of the story, every detail that gets us to the final scene. Quite a few of the stories progress via fairly banal writing, offering sentences such as: âJoyce has given me a great deal over the years. Sheâs made plenty of sacrificesâ (37), or: âHis gaze pierces my soulâ (136), or: âMy wife looks like an angel when she sleeps (141). Often, the stories in first person (or even second person) work much better (seem much more immediate) than those presented as if from a distant third-person narrator. For example, the story, âJohnny Longswordâs Third Option,â has quite a vivid voice. And, finally, there are a few quite fabulous moments in the collection, just not enough for me to believe in this manuscript as a book.'),(265,56,253,1,3,1,'2014-04-07','2014-03-10',NULL,'There are many lovely things about this manuscript: first, itâs beautifully written, its use of language often poetic and always interesting. Second, it captures the rich complexities of human relationships, including the struggles, the transitions, the epiphanies, and both the awe-inspiring and the terrible life-changing moments. Third, thereâs something deeply moving about its exploration of faith and spirituality and its charactersâ desires to reach higher states of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript is not without its issues, though; the main problem for me was its narrative voice. It presents four different sections, each offering a different point of view at a different point in time, but each is not handled with equal skill. For example, the point of view of David, a middle-aged academic, is absolutely believable; however, that of 11-year-old Lev, while seemingly credible at times, occasionally lapses into the point of view of an adult trying to imitate an 11-year-old boy. Similarly, Samaraâs point of view (that of a young lesbian woman) does not seem authentic at times, either (surprisingly, though, I thought some of the most beautiful prose appeared in the section that was written from Samaraâs point of view). I donât think these narrative voice issues are insurmountable, but they did stick out as problematic.\r\n\r\nAlso, I didnât feel I understood enough about the Jewish faith to fully appreciate the complexities of the charactersâ internal struggles and explorations. Some of the explanations within the text were helpful, but I must confess that many bored me, and I genuinely wanted to skip over them. Iâm not sure if others would find this a barrier, but there were times I found it so.\r\n\r\nOverall, I found the manuscript to be an interesting and engaging read.

The oil economy is a mere backdrop to the plot, but it drives motivation and provides the wealth that rots those who would gain illegally and immorally from it. \r\nI believe the subject of this novel is important, more than any editorial issues that follow. They can be fixed, with a strong hand and a green penâand the authorâs willingness.\r\n\r\nAsher, the protagonist, is hired by the premier, Jimmy Karamanlis, to look into the second-degree murder conviction of one of his Cabinet, Victor Turlock. Turlock has run over an accountant named John Apson in a small town that could be Red Deer (most place names are changed; even the capital city isnât called Edmonton). Karamanlis wants Asher to dig into it; he is worried that thereâs more to the âaccidentâ and that whatever it is will come back to bite him politically.\r\n\r\nWhen Asher starts investigating, it seems that Apson had found evidence of something big, something that frightened him, something that might reveal a decades-old scandal involving a former legendary premier, aka The Parson. Apsonâs widow, Angela, is frightened; so is her brother Kelsey. They donât know what Apson found, or claim they donât know.  A romantic relationship begins to develop between Angela and Asher. Itâs believable because Angela and Apson had been separated for a long time, when he became increasingly anxious and paranoid by something that she didnât understand and that he didnât reveal to her. Asher is reluctantly divorced.\r\n\r\nThese are my criticisms\r\nWhy the Mozart museum for the musicianâs relics? Would this fly in Alberta? If the author is being ironic, I didnât get it. The museum is an excuse for a financial boondoggle, but it isnât convincing.\r\nDialogue is somewhat stilted; there are long passages of unquoted dialogue that drag the action down, which I believe should be in dialogue. \r\nDialogue punctuation needs attentionâlong sections of a single speaker. Sometimes, the paragraph breaks may stop the reader who may wonder if the speaker has changed. One possibility is to add breaks in these long dialogues, like: He paused and took a long drink from the Alley Cat Amber. OR, The old man stopped talking and stared ahead into a long alley of memories. OR: Karamanlis picked at the shoelace of his expensive, smooth leather slip-ons.  \r\n\r\nNumbers or words: go to Chicago rules.\r\n\r\nRelationship with Angela. It works for this reader, but could be sexier (see kiss on p.  71). Asher seems to be open to finding a relationship (see his comments on the prosecutor in the opening pages) so his fast attraction to Angela may be seen by readers as him being very lonely. He misses his ex-wife very much.  The plan to meet for a tryst seems too practical all of a sudden, as if Angela is used to this sort of thing, which I donât believe. Perhaps this section could be taken out of dialogue and simplified. Also, I canât âseeâ her âshe needs to be described more fully than having a trim waist. What color are her eyes? Hair?  At first I assumed a mousy sort of woman, when she first enters the scene.===OK, I see writer is bringing her into focus more in the succeeding pages. Perhaps she should be more fully realized descriptively earlier on. I liked the bit about the flannel nightgown. Angela is not a kid, having a one-night stand. Sheâs a grownup. Her fear as the novel progresses is real to me.\r\n\r\nDaughter, Amy. I only discovered her name on p. 171. Asher talks about how much Amy means to him, but we donât have scenes that convey this. Writer could inject a couple of incidents where this relationship is shown to be a loving one.\r\n\r\nMozart music museum is, as I said earlier, far-fetched. Hard to imagine a museum for Mozart reliquaries being of interest in Alberta and for the many millions the museum was going to cost. Doesnât work for me. Can the author come up with a more likely excuse for a boondoggle in Alberta? How about a museum for The Parson? Or how about a hockey arena? 8^)\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the authorâs gorgeous descriptive writing on the Alberta landscape, the small-town settings; the minor characters are well defined. He has written lots of engaging discussions on politics and philosophy, which lifts this novel out of the ordinary.

My reaction to this manuscript is that itâs not my cup of tea (so to speak), but that it _may_ fit within the wider arc of other manuscripts weâve published. I do think it gets a bit clichÃ©d in the second half (with references to love-at-first-sight, and when the persona described lovemaking as: âYou see my hardness: an ink-stained loveâ (22) and, âI open my sexâ (24).\r\n\r\nOverall, âDesire, Fragmentsâ is fairly well written and puts forth some strong and gorgeous imagery. For example, when the lyric âyouâ gives the persona âa handful of stonesâ (9 Atopos), or, âMy mouth replaces your mouthâ (â57 Monstreux / Monstrousâ).\r\n\r\nBut itâs also full of bland explanation writing that conveys the personaâs ideas, without an accompanying focus on language. For example, âItâs true that Iâve disappointed you. / For me, it is a sense of loss you have / to realize in your heart you are but dust, / never remembered but just a glance of airâ (â63 Pleurer / Cryingâ), or âOh yes I have loved you from the very first moment I saw youâ (â66 Ravissement / Ravishmentâ). As well, there are many purportedly âpoeticâ lines that fall flat. For example, âLanguage rides the blood on horsebackâ (24 DÃ©claration / Declaration). This kind of image convinces readers of the âpoetry-nessâ of such a line, but leads nowhere in terms of the image. (There is no further horseback riding; rather, the poem is about how words have power.)\r\n\r\nFurther, lines such as, âNatural disasters invade my heartâ (â5 Alterationâ) sound good (sort of), but merely present a generic image, and one that in this case is imbedded within mixed metaphors: _which_ natural disasters, particularly? _How_ does an earthquake, say, or a river flooding âinvadeâ the body (and Iâm not saying a body doesnât respond to such overwhelming occurrences, but the poem doesnât explore how living through or finding out about âdisastersâ can write upon oneâs own body)? The way in which readers must accept such a line is in embracing the clichÃ©s that abound in terms of the heart as metaphor for love and empathy. Rather than explore complicated human negotiations and emotional consequences, the poem merely takes short-cuts via abstract language.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the line, âI hold your hand but am afraid of / subtle demands and sacrificesâ (â8 Askesisâ) doesnât show the speakerâs fear, but only names it. Concrete images of those demands and sacrifices would let readers know how subtle or overt they are, how much the speaker gives, and what â specifically â the speaker risks.'),(271,29,216,3,4,2,'2014-03-22','2014-03-20',NULL,'A highly appropriate title for a Novella set in Lloydminster, which boasts the largest border markers in the world â four 100-feet high survey markers.

The narrator tells and explains absolutely every detail in this piece, such as: âCraigâs mood wasnât always so positive all day, but when he was around his caring and lovely family, he was a warm and affectionate man,â and âShe was attending the fourth grade and each day was filled with new and exciting discoveries in school, at church on Sundays and at home with all the things she learned on TV and from reading books which she loved to do.â You couldnât force me to read this entire manuscript once, let alone several times!!\r\n'),(280,157,263,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-04-05',NULL,NULL),(281,35,268,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-04-05',NULL,NULL),(282,28,269,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-04-05',NULL,NULL),(283,24,266,1,3,1,'2014-04-21','2014-04-05',NULL,'By which I mean that if I edited it, I would probably work fairly heavily on some aspects of this ms.

Stevenson is taking a long, hard look at a North America that has a deep and grisly fascination with serial killers, an almost cult following of the depraved. At the same time, even this fascination is disposable; like most of pop culture, it\\\'s easily replaced by the next horrible thing, the latest killer who\\\'s topped the previous record-holder\\\'s count, and Stevenson is careful to place Olson in the timeline with Dahmer and his predecessor, Robert Picton.

I found it easy to sympathize with her in her confused state, especially for the first half of the manuscript, as I witnessed her unpacking of her experiences living with Jasper (initially her abductor and captor and then her lover) and Matty, their young son, after Mattyâs illness causes them to seek emergency medical attention for him and she re-enters the âreal world.â Krissyâs initial professions of love for Jasper and her dedication to trying to protect him are infuriating for those around her, especially her family and the detective, Jake, who has been looking after her case for the past four years.\r\n\r\nHowever, approximately half way through the manuscript, the story starts to unravel and never really comes back together. Krissy attaches herself too quickly to the detective, adapts too easily to ânormalâ family life, and sets herself up independently from Jasper in a way that is a little too contrived: she works for the therapist who is helping her and starts dating Jake, both conflicts of interest that her family seems to support, which is unlikely given their overall concerns about her state of mind and well-being. Although her memories of life in the wilderness with Jasper are vivid and detailed, and her motivations for her behaviour at that time, though inconsistent, are believable, her words, story, and motivations in the âreal worldâ of the novel are less interesting, less plausible, and less likely to gain the readerâs sympathies. The pacing of Krissyâs life back in the community is also problematic, as huge chunks of information are missing or glossed over, which seems inconsistent with the amount of detail provided of her life in the bush.\r\n\r\nThe ending is problematic as well, as we are led to believe that Jake is mentally ill and is responsible for Jasperâs death, and itâs implied that Krissy may start dating her therapist.

The omniscient narrator remains anonymous until the final revelation, but presents himself as a neutral observer. This perspective quickly loses credibility, and the narrator often indulges in political diatribes against the machinations of the US and its attempts at world domination, and philosophical reflections on the nature of revolutions. There are intriguing historical details about the involvement of the Jewish mafia in the casinos; and the support of another CIA agent named William Morgan for Castroâs guerilla army, followed by his execution when he changed his mind about Castro as a communist. The title of the novel is the name of a radio station which broadcast CIA propaganda against the Castro regime, attributed to Sonjaâs husband in the story.

She is part-Aboriginal, her father was abusiveâirrationally and unexpectedly violent, an alcoholic, tooâher mother helpless. It is set in Yellowknife over several years, from Melissaâs childhood to her adulthood, and has a real sense of place throughout.

The vulnerability that can throw a person into addiction in the first place and keep her there. Through her story we also follow several other charactersâ stories. The reasons for the charactersâ addictions, both chemical and alcohol, in this book go back to their childhoods; they have terrible devils. \r\n\r\nThe book is not a downerâit is hopeful with solid people, such as Melissaâs sponsor, Dot, Eliza and Frank, both recovered alcoholics and community leaders. Each has a distinct personality. Some humour: The scene when a very nervous Melissa makes a spaghetti dinner for her AA friends is priceless.

It initially advances its account of unconstrained life in the Dawson City and the Yukon through three perspectives: an alcoholic, degenerate salmon fisher named MacPhinney, a loner native named Charley, and the primary narrator, a young man named Sam, who has recently graduated with an English degree, and has come to Dawson City to be with a newly acquired girlfriend. It begins well with MacPhinneyâs suspicious death under the wheels of his truck, and tracks back in time to include many side excursions which explore primal life in the Yukon wilds, the art of net fishing for salmon, and caribou hunting. Sam is the innocent novice in the north who experiences just about everything â from boozing in bars to killing a grizzly, with MacPhinney as his unlikely mentor. In fact, we finally learn that he writes Macâs story at his request in a letter hidden in his tent and posthumously discovered by Sam. This scenario is too contrived to be credible, and smacks of the revelations at the end of a murder mystery, when all is neatly explained.\r\n   There are pointed opinions on dubious Native rights issues and political correctness, as a local corrupt chief lays claim to MacPhinneyâs fishing camp, and Mac fights back through legal and illegal means. MacPhinney articulates opinions which appear out-of-character in their lucidity and rationality: âGovernment knows damn well that keeping the tribal system intact will keep them from ever getting any real power.â This is accounted for by Samâs belated discovery that although Mac may appear to be a drunken bum, he is in fact a university grad. Charley, a variation of the ânoble savage,â accused of Macâs murder, breaks his stoic silence occasionally to advance a more positive perspective on Native issues. Although as a âtown Indian,â he succumbs to drink, he incarnates the best of traditional Native values. Samâs relationship with a local elder also provides a sympathetic account of Native exploitation and loss, and a platform for the authorâs political and social views. There are âgood Indiansâ and âbad Indians.â \r\n   The portrait of Dawson City in the summer in the 1990s, as a âtown full of caricatures,â with its German tourists, wanna-be northerners, transient workers, and hippies is graphic and entertaining, and descriptions of the landscape are often compelling and evocative.

There are many accounts of tragic accidents in the mountains, but the tone remains positive, although cautionary.  He explains the formation and avoidance of crevasses in glaciers, how to cope when holed up during a storm, the reasons for and possible lethal consequences of altitude sickness, what food to take for a long trek.  \r\nWilliâs first job was to guide two groups on horseback through the Rogers Pass, before the construction of a highway.

The narrator of House of Spells, a young woman named Lacey, has come to this unnamed country in search of Michael Guzzo, to bring him the news that he is a father. Laceyâs friend Rose, back in a rural town in B.C., has had a child that is Michaelâs.\r\n\r\nThere are two narrative strands to the novel: one, the story of Laceyâs journey in search of Michael, is narrated in the first person by a man named Bernabe Matias, a rural teacher who helps refugees from his region cross the border into Mexico (although this narrative sometimes slips into Laceyâs p.o.v.) The second narrative strand, involving Michaelâs experiences in the unnamed country, is narrated in the third-person, but mostly from Michaelâs perspective.\r\n\r\nAs with Pepper-Smithâs earlier manuscripts at the time they were submitted to NeWest, the writing is gorgeous and poetic, observing people and the world with tenderness, deep feeling and compassion.  At the same time, aspects of plot, character, motivation and action are in need in focus and clarification. Itâs not always clear why the characters are doing certain things, nor is it even clear at times who is being referred to, as a result of vague pronoun reference (the author tends to overuse âheâ and âsheâ when naming the character at various points during a scene would quickly orient the reader). The later scenes of the novel, especially the scene in which Lacey and Michael are smuggled across the border by Bernabe, are anti-climactic and little more than summary â these scenes need to be expanded (and itâs not really clear why the characters have to be smuggled out like this).\r\n\r\nIn summary, this third novel has all the strengths of the earlier two novels, and in fact is probably stronger than the other two were at manuscript stage. It does need substantive editing to deal with the issues outlined above, but I recommend that NeWest publish it.

It is very good on the body-building, but Iâm not sure how interesting that would be to a general audience (although, again, the specifics of 70s work with steroids still being thought of as good for such activities, is interesting). And i guess the narratorâs various encounters with the criminal underground in Hamilton, as well as his 2 girlfriends, with whom he seems to be bereaving up in the idle of the summer.

Then the âlooking backâ at the prescient feeling that rings were going to go south. So, yes,  kind of thriller-tension, but for me the way the narrator has failed to engage my sympathy makes it less involving than it should be.

And why is he philosophical now, when heâs shown no knack for it before? Iâm not getting a solid read on the character (then, or now narrating). Nevertheless, Chap 12 is moving, & the narrator impinges in an interesting way, now telling us how he is remembering but not fully.

Perhaps it is the narrative voice, which seems to shift back and forth from the main character in the moment in the story to the main character many years later, after time for reflection and with a much larger vocabulary. In any case, what seems to me to be frequent changes in voice are difficult for me to reconcile, and the shifts fracture and fragment the story for me.

She lives in an historic old house, and is reluctant to move in with her son and his family, since she believes they expect free babysitting. She meets regularly with her friends, the Crones, and their conversations cover a wide range of grievances of older women â the shortcoming of the medical and social systems, ageism, lack of meaningful work, the disrespect of the young. But Jess also has judgmental views on the young, and on her daughter-in-law. Like Hagar Shipley in The Stone Angel, she can be cranky and critical, but occasionally witty and shrewd.

The title of each story ironically alludes to a menu item from a Chinese restaurant, and references a memory or incident in the life of the family. The perspective shifts in each story, and often within each story, which can be confusing, disrupting the narrative line and character development.  Typically, the narrator is a young child, who cannot speak Chinese, and is caught between the expectations and assumptions of very different societies. The writing is highly imagistic and detailed, evoking the history and customs of the family, and particular locations in Edmontonâs Chinatown area.  The pervasive theme is one of cultural collision and adjustment: there are many examples of racism and prejudice, ignorance and cruelty, directed against Chinese immigrants and their families through several generations. In some stories, interjected âNotesâ provide editorial comment, or connect past events to the present; these might more effectively be integrated within the narrative or eliminated. Although the different family perspectives afford a variety of characters, and the time shifts provide a historical record of the Chinese community in Edmonton and Calgary, the total effect appears repetitious, as the childhood memories accumulate. Digressions into accounts of the experiences of extended family members and friends can also distract, and the narrative is occasionally entangled in a hyper prose style.

Ho hum.\r\n\r\nThe northern setting gives the novel a stark quality, and intrigued me in terms of geography and narrative movement.

There are hints of tension between Jenny and her parents (that they havenât spoken in years), yet she immediately leaves Iqaluit (even though her work there is important for her dissertation) to visit her mother. So: what will capture readersâ interest is dropped very quickly, and the book plunges into an extremely long flashback (from page 30 to well into the 400s) that ends up being the bulk of the (extremely long) novel: Jennyâs (incredibly unspectacular) childhood.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the northern setting and family complications are compelling and make me want to read more; on the other hand, the writing is fairly straight-forward and bland and the family drama drags out for way, way too long.

OK, there are a few fun lines, such as: âShe was an art historian, yet here she should have been a geographer, geologist, something geoâ (1), but itâs mostly uninspired writing, such as: âDominic looked at Jenny.

Her account incorporates extensive academic research, as she tracks the history of the Mudflats through the rich archive of the NFB, and draws correspondences with the dispossession of Natives peoples in the early 1900s, and the popular culture in the 1970s â such as Altmanâs McCabe and Mrs. Miller, filmed near the Mudflats. The oscillation between a broad historical perspective and her autobiography, with detailed accounts of the consequences of her fatherâs alcoholism, her motherâs forbearance, and her own preliminary expressions of independence through a nascent feminism, appears contrived at times, but Walton has the remarkable ability to see the personal in the political. In the process, she provides an insight into the creation and significance of memoir.  The extensive quotes from Lowry, and from social activists such as Paul Spong, sometimes sidetrack the memoir, but Walton usually restores the balance through thematic correspondences.

The repeated reference to the Native wives who play drums and dance on the periphery as âthe peanut galleryâ is problematic. \r\nAlthough this novel is original, complex, and clever, it requires a substantive pruning to realize its full potential, especially of the scenes from the voyageur documentary. \r\n'),(375,29,355,1,2,1,'2014-12-12','2014-12-02',NULL,'There is lots of important, informative material in this âmemoirâ by Mansoor Ladha â an Ismaili who emigrated to Canada from Tanzania in the 1970s, when Asians in East Africa were dispossessed by Black majority governments post-independence -- especially the history of the Ismaili diaspora from India to Africa and then to Canada. However, this MS does not offer a consistent narrative, but an assortment of chapters on a wide range of subjects: the authorâs family life in Tanzania and his university years, when he was expelled for his opposition to socialist government policy; his early work with Canadian newspapers in Sudbury, Edmonton and Morinville, including a chapter on the importance of community weeklies, and their lack of advertising support by local business.  It begins with an adaptation of a lament for a lost paradise by another exile â recounting all that he has given up to live in a dreary cold climate, and âOut of Africaâ is sometimes an embittered lament on the injustices and racism suffered by Ladha, even though he occasionally emphasizes the more positive benefits of his adopted country.  And he is not shy about parading his own accomplishments or name-dropping (his meeting the Aga Kahn, for example). His account of the racial hierarchy in East Africa is compelling, but he sometimes resorts to disconcerting generalizations such as âeveryone in East Africa hates Asiansâ and the Asians hate themselves â a legacy of British colonial rule. And he contradicts himself, as the âmemoirâ jumps from African past to Canadian present and back. There is considerable repetition of historical and personal detail, as each chapter loses sight of the others. The readership is sometimes addressed as young Ismailis, unaware of their history, sometimes as uninformed generic Canadians, sometimes as aspiring writers, whom Ladha warns against the difficulties of publishing new work (based on his own disappointments).  It \\\"concludes\\\" with appendices and epilogues â on the Asian pioneers of East Africa, on the Ismaili faith as an attempt to counter prejudices against Muslims, and on his first trip to India, which has all the insight of a tourist brochure. \r\nLadha has previously published works on the Ismaili faith, focusing on the Aga Khan in A Portrait on Pluralism (Detselig 2008), and a chapter on his immigrant experience in The Story That Brought Me Here (ed. Linda Goyette).  Sections of this MS would be better placed in cultural/historical journals such as Alberta Views. Although M.G. Vassanji has published autobiographical works on his âin-betweenâ experiences as an Asian in Tanzania and Canada, there is still little awareness in this country of East African history and culture, and the ways in which they are colour Canada culture and politics (e.g. Naheed Nenshi is the son of an immigrant from Tanzania.)    \r\n'),(376,316,356,1,3,1,'2015-02-02','2014-12-02',NULL,'The brief description scarcely does justice to this failed effort to create, if not a Finnish WAR AND PEACE, something more akin to a Finnish DOCTOR ZIVAGO.

Paul\\\'s athletic failure and the difference between his social class and Tina\\\'s render him incapable of proposing marriage, and drive him into a funk as well as the arms of Marita, with whom -- we learn in the denouement -- he fathers a son. \r\n\r\nShift to Helsinki, autumn of 1939, as the Russo-Finnish \\\"Winter War\\\" clouds loom, and the story -- competently written, but rather dull and plodding to this point -- becomes more engaging. Back are journalists Henderson and Taylor to cover the diplomatic crisis and ensuing war. Paul is called up to his unit to defend the \\\"Mannerheim Line\\\" in Karelia, and Tom Henderson and Tina Bjornstrom fall madly in love. Although their affair is only partially consummated, Tina is wracked with guilt over her \\\"almost-fiance\\\'s\\\" plight defending their country against the seemingly overwhelming might of the Red Army. \r\n\r\nReturning to Helsinki on leave from the front, and bearing a wedding ring in his pocket, Paul belatedly seeks out Tina to propose marriage, only to find her dancing with Tom Henderson. Suspecting the truth, he flees into the night, pursued by Tina, but escapes, once again into the arms and bed of Marita. Paul returns to the Karelian front and is killed. At length, an armistice is negotiated, and Finland cedes Karelia and other territory to the Soviets. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tina learns of Paul and Marita\\\'s \\\"love-child\\\", being raised by Paul\\\'s grandmother on her farm in ceded Karelia, and sets out to rescue the pair before the Russians move in. Frantic for her safety, Tom sets out to find Tina, aided by Taylor\\\'s Russian connections. Although he secures the safe repatriation of the three Finns across the newly established frontier border, he is detained by the Russians, disappears into the Soviet Union, and is never heard from again. Despondent by the loss of Tom, Tina takes the child and emigrates to Canada, ending up decades later in her home on Vancouver Island, from which vantage the entire story is told in flashback.  \r\n\r\nThe author writes well, the historical and geographical backgrounds are well grounded, and the characters are well developed and appealing. But the narrative fails to grip for upwards of the first 100 pages. The contrived flashback with which the story begins and ends would be better replaced by starting with the tension created by the looming Winter War -- framing the encounters at the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a flashback, or, better still, discarding that episode altogether.

Good references to Greek mythology, some funny lines, and even intriguing dialogue (once he meets up with other characters). At first, he wanders through corridors that have the appearance of an office building without doors or windows. After a while, he travels through other buildings, snowy floors, woodland, etc. Surprisingly, the endless hallways donât read as tedious, but when he begins to get âoutâ (ie, into new buildings, bridges, rivers, woods) the landscape seems bland and repetitive. Interspersed between chapters that depict the narratorâs near-eternal loop are chapters showing his childhood days with his grandmother. This balance works well, and images from one timeline often leak into the other.\r\n\r\nGood opening (Theseus and the minotaur). Intriguing (empty white-washed hallways, and nothing more), but a bit bland. Gerbil comparison works but is a bit obvious, though it balances well with the more terror-inspiring minotaur imagery. For example, the flashback to him in a corn maze as a kid, being chased by a minotaur works really well. (and subsequently fits well with the Stetson hat the narrator wears and the hoof print he finds in the drywall dust, etc.). And nice to see the talking owl show up, after earlier information about his grandmother loving all things owl (111-113).\r\n\r\nOverall, some really good writing: His child version of the minotaur myth (25). âA maze is no place for a minotaurâ (26); âA local with no knowledge of the locale?â (43); on the one of the final bridges, the figures below look to him as âechoesâ to Willowâs appearance as a ghost (132).\r\n\r\nBut thereâs definitely some weak writing: she âpeered down at me dubiouslyâ (8); âran blindlyâ (10); âthe white, virginal wonderlandâ (109), âlittle white lieâ (134), the âadventure left her eyesâ after the grandfather dies (169). Characters do a lot of âgrinningâ and âlaughingâ and shrugging, throughout the manuscript. The descriptions of these minor actions needs to be much stronger, each expression or gesture letting readers know more about the character (or he/r situation). Thereâs quite a bit of telling in this manuscript, but as greater part consists of strong writing, Iâm sure that can be fixed at the editing stage.\r\n\r\nA few editing pointers: as this is a book that, turns out, is all about grief, the flashbacks with the grandmother need to be stronger. Readers may believe they are going into tangential excursions, waiting to get back to the âmysteryâ of the guy lost in the maze, but when the book ends, those scenes need to resonate powerfully. Iâd lose most of the info about the parents (all we need to know is that they dump the kid on the fatherâs mother), cousins, acting-out-teen info, etc. In other words: generic growing up scenes. Stick to what is unique about the grandmother, and â it will then follow â what is unique about their relationship.\r\n\r\nThe one flashback revealing him as writer (56) is rather ho humâ¦\r\n\r\nThe first-person point-of-view gets a bit wearying, especially as heâs supposed to be in the throes of confusion and terror and pain and other negative emotions, but the explanatory voice seems quite distant and detached from the events taking place (the best example comes late in the book. After teasing the reader with notions of whether the hoof prints and the clicking hoof-like noises in the corridors really are a minotaur, Peters has his narrator relate this (sort of) climax: âI angle myself under a corner of the bridge, so that I can watch the sky for any sign of alleviation. I hug my knees to my chest. I rub my arms with pruney hands, attempt to rediscover warmth. Well, I think grimly, this is what I wanted. I\\\'m free of the glass bridges. I look back up at the bridge, only to see the minotaur looking down. My gasp of horror rises as a fog before my face, but I\\\'m too cold and weary to do anything more than try and shrink further into the shadowsâ (167). In the editing stage, Peters must ensure that the writing conveys the characterâs emotions, rather than not simply report them.\r\n\r\nThe ending works well, showing that â all along â the narrator has been dealing with his grandmotherâs death, trapped inside grief, unable to figure out how to go forward. I think, so, some (many?) of the images need more grounding (that the grandmother is original Italian, would I think, require very few sprinklings of details, and then resonate at the end).'),(381,89,365,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-20',NULL,NULL),(382,317,334,1,2,3,'2015-02-17','2015-01-20',NULL,'This manuscript, âHow We Dancedâ by Deborah Serravalle is primarily a story about Alastair and his wife Lily and âdaughterâ Jennifer.  âThe other two characters of importance are David and Aaron.

It was inevitably shut down, however, and three of the actors murdered, as was Serumaga during the political infighting following Aminâs departure. After fleeing to Rome, Charles attempted to survive as an artist, and finally immigrated as a refugee to Canada â Edmonton, in fact.

His story must move from ice to fire, from tornado to torture, from here to there and back.â \r\nKeeney encountered Charles when he moved to Toronto for more surgery following his tornado trauma. There he met George Seremba, author of the play, Come Good Rain, and through him the York U. drama professor Don Rubin (editor of The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre).

However, this heightened account is neither a reliable theatre history, nor a convincing myth, and Charles is no hero. His character remains unrealized, because the conversations with others appear fabricated, and his responses to the many diverse experiences appear unconvincing, despite occasional passages of imagistic prose to evoke place and time. (Keeney is also a poet.)\r\nThe Prologue opens in Brooks, Alberta, where Charles is working in a meat-packing plant, and highlights his love of dancing and women. His life-story flashes before his eyes when his car is tossed by the tornado. But when the story moves back to his childhood in Uganda, there is a change in style and tone, and it sometimes appears like a history lesson, as the influences of the British colonial system are described. Charlesâs fraught childhood is recounted in detail as a precursor to his life as an artist. The independence movement and Aminâs military coup provide a political backdrop, as he learns drumming and acting, and joins Abafumi.

It is competently written, and several of the familial relationships are believable. I found it easy to sympathize several of the characters as well, and I was genuinely interested in finding out what would happen to them. And although I generally dislike a narrative voice that tells the story from the perspectives of several of the characters, this authorâs use of such a narrative voice is more effective than that of many Iâve read.\r\n\r\nNow the negatives: This story is absolutely implausible (not necessarily a terrible thing) and relies too heavily on character types. Perhaps because my husband is a social worker who advocates for runaway teenagers on a daily basis, I was consistently irked by the idealistic and romanticized portrayal of Hannah and her connection to her foster family. Even worse, her presence seems to heal them, the unlikeliest outcome of all. The story is complete fantasy, which would be okay if it werenât presented so realistically in other regards. The only genuine potential complication is Hannahâs relationship with her new foster brother, Daniel. Their infatuation with each other could ruin the family dynamic, and this could be an interesting direction for the story to take, but it fails to explore this relationship.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think itâs publishable, and I think people will enjoy it.

The sympathetic cop fears for her safety, and takes a special interest in a girl who has survived on the streets of Edmonton for sixty days, fearing that she is being returned to an abusive relationship with her stepfather. In many respects, this novel resembles The Shore Girl: a girl at risk finds some measure of security through the kind auspices of a caring man, and through an unlikely relationship with a teenage boy who is also going through his own emotional turmoil. Although Kimmel is a skilled writer, imaginatively evoking winter scenes through creative imagery, and building suspense, the story is minimal and predictable. The cop rescues the girl from the evil stepfather (whose actions remain inexplicable), she stays with his family over Christmas, and is saved from a foster home by the last-minute decision of the wife to keep her. \r\nThe perspective shifts from one character to another: cop, wife, son, girl, but the characters are never fully or credibly realized. Much attention is paid to the dysfunctional wife, Ellie, who has had five (yes five) miscarriages in an attempt to have a daughter by her second husband the cop Garnett. Her teenage son, Daniel is from a first marriage. Garnett and Ellie have an autistic son, who is a great cause for concern, and they also have a resident grandfather with dementia. As if this were not enough, Ellie is stressed out about Christmas preparations, haunted by the amazing precedent set by her mother-in-law. Her ongoing anguish over the Christmas tree, ornaments, and presents, becomes rather tiresome â as does her talent for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time to just about everybody.      \r\nThe runaway, Hannah, is angelic in her selflessness, her thoughtful consideration of others despite her own suffering. The description of her graphic memories of her kind mother borders on the sentimental, as does the description of her beautiful singing, which brings comfort and joy to others. And there is a big loveable old family dog which saves her in a snow storm, when she goes out into the cold to rescue the wandering grandfather.  \r\nThe plethora of domestic details stalls the action, without contributing much to a development of character or theme.  Likewise the charactersâ memories provide their history, but seem contrived to evoke sympathy for their frustration and unhappiness.

However, the manuscript presents instead fragments of the stories of many characters, including that of Rose (named in the title), the best friend (and secret crush) of Martha.\r\n\r\nAlthough I liked the premise, I found the collection of stories contained within the chapters somewhat disparate and difficult to reconcile as all part of the same manuscript, even though the author does an admirable job of trying to interweave them.  We learn of Roseâs sons, Jake and Cornie, seriously disfigured in a fire, who live isolated lives in terrible conditions and rely on television and Roseâs care to get them through their daily lives. We also learn of Roseâs husband, Clarence, a welder who spends his time creating metal sculptures, who sacrifices his relationships, his livelihood, his vision, and ultimately his life for his art. And then there is Marthaâs brother, a religious fanatic who speaks in biblical quotations and spends his time building an ark. The two menâs lives collide when a blinded, injured, and naked Clarence wanders into the ark, each man singularly obsessed with his art and vision. Clarence is later found by Martha, crucified in the ark, which she accidentally sets on fire.\r\n\r\nThe strange melding of old and new testament and the odd ways in which the menâs visions are revealed and portrayed seem so completely at odds with Marthaâs and Rose\\\'s stories.

The mother has been institutionalized for a bi-polar condition, and the two adolescent daughters, Cleo and Mandalay, have been taking care of their three younger brothers. The story unfolds from their perspectives, and that of the second son, Cliff, who have been in communication as they grow into adulthood in foster homes, effecting comparisons in the choices they make in relationships and work, and the ways in which they have dealt with the family trauma. They are shown to be very different in many respects, but also strongly conditioned by their early lives in an isolated community, their loss of the youngest brother, taken from them as a baby, and the death of the eldest brother. They discover that the baby has been raised by an affluent Vancouver family, and their meeting triggers a reunion with the mother, who still lives in Butterfly Lake with a second husband. The pieces of the family puzzle are placed skillfully, and the revelations subtle as misperceptions are adjusted in this well-paced novel. The fraught, sometimes critical sibling relationships are conveyed very convincingly: their deep-seated fears and feelings of guilt condition their choices, yet they are shown to be capable of self-determination.  Cleo can finally free herself from a fearful obsession with her two young children, and exercise her education and abilities by undertaking a fulfilling job; Mandalay decides to forfeit some personal independence by having a child, despite her loverâs reticence, and Cliff finds self-confidence and happiness on a trip to Maui with his younger brother.  Hofmannâs writing is accomplished and evocative, particularly in descriptions of Melanieâs kayak trip to Haida Gwai with her lover Duane, in which landscape is internalized and sensuous: e.g. âAnd around them a temple of green shawls.â  Her detailed knowledge of the West Coast flora and fauna informs the ways in which her characters relate to their environments.

Set in Montreal, and focusing on a Jewish family, it recalls a colourful chapter in Canadian history through the protagonistâs obsessive loyalty to a small museum located in the Bay, but like the museum which it portrays, this novel tends to be limited by trivial details of the quotidian life of his family, which he believes is âheld together with duct tape.â  Although his widowed mother is sympathetic and supportive, he cannot forgive his father for his sexual trysts, and feels persecuted by his siblings. Benâs witty observations are muted by his depressed attitude to life and his self-pity: he feels limited by a useless B.A. degree, and helpless against the Bay bosses who want to close the museum. His friendship with another voyageur aficionado, whom he catches robbing the museum, provides an entrÃ©e into the lives of the old and discarded remnants of a more gentile society.

Even when they finally reunite, it\'s only to find that what they thought was true about the past was more nuanced than they could grasp as children at the time, and that the intervening years in the foster care system left deep marks on them all. Can they pull together again as a family?

Kit has moved to Nelson from England via Australia, where she met her hockey-player husband; she doesnât pretend to be the perfect mother and resists new-age parental advice. Genevieve previously lived in Toronto, and has abandoned a care-free past in her quest for physical, mental, and nutritional perfection via diet and yoga. Hilary is wholly absorbed with being the perfect parent to her five-year-old son, whom she is still breast-feeding; she loves The Sound of Music and garage sales. Sasha is more absorbed in her own appearance than her sonâs well-being.  Other than Sasha, who abandoned a media job in Vancouver when she became pregnant, none of the women seems to have had any work or career: they are portrayed primarily in terms of the minutiae of the daily tedium of child-rearing.  They all meet at a monthly book club, hosted by Genevieve, and catered by her submissive husband. There is little in the way of plot: Book Club is primarily a humorous and ironic character study, and the critical tone is aligned with Kitâs impatience with the absurd local obsessions with environment, nutrition, and post-hippy culture. The book choices for âdiscussionâ provide an opportunity for Kit (aka Roz) to critique the vacuity of recent best-sellers like The Time Travelerâs Wife, Eat, Pray, Love, and Fifty Shades of Gray (although none of the women read the books). The radically different values of the women soon devolve into antagonism, and finally an all-out physical battle in Genevieveâs backyard, but they persist in attending the âmeetings,â resorting more and more to alcohol to survive. More complications ensue when a handsome yoga instructor is invited to participate. But there is a form of revelation and resolution when they finally confront each other and articulate their frustration, and then Genevieve once again issues invitations to attend the book club. They need each other more than they have realized. The writing is witty, clear, engaging. This novel would probably be a popular item for book clubs â although it may also irritate Nelsonites.  Kitâs husbandâs observation on the habits of Nelson Type A personalities is particularly astute (and hilarious): âRural High Achievers kept with them a Power Bar, an efficiently rolled fleece, and a space blanket. They squeezed four jobs, three hobbies and five children into their lifestyle, and weekends existed solely as a contest to see who could be busiest, worthiest and closest to nature.â But he also counsels Kit to lighten up in her critique of the local loonies, and appreciate what the town and the country have to offer.

I would also observe that the submitted manuscript has Tracked Changes remaining in places, which suggests some carelessness on the part of the author. Not a great sign. And the novel is long â 346 pages as submitted â and wouldn\'t be hurt by some judicious cutting. The minute-by-minute story-telling sometimes drags. \r\n\r\nThose criticisms aside, this is a solid book. It\'s not what NWP has done historically, but it is certainly in keeping with what we\'ve been publishing in the last two or three years.

Although the images are striking and original â for example âa photograph of a painting of the Last Supper on a grain of riceâ (17) and âBuoy (standing) very ashamedâ (104) â this manuscript could definitely use more focus on verbs: there is an excessive reliance on verbs such as âhaveâ and the verb âto beâ where the language should be a lot stronger. For example, the poem â227â opens with these four lines, leaning heavily on the least interesting verb in English:\r\n\r\nI AM in one of the innumerable rooms, and the outstanding characteristic of these rooms IS that the doors ARE always open, or nearly always. From this I recall that at one time, work WAS done by collaboration, by exchange of ideas.  Someone WAS once...\r\n\r\nâAutoportrait: Momâ opens with a plethora of the second least interesting English verb:\r\n\r\nShe HAD found the most wonderful doll and she HAD lost all her babyish dependence and pliability, but she HAD found her nose and eyes. She HAD lost the 50 cents with which her mother HAD entrusted her to buy a sackful of badly needed groceries, but she HAD found a marble â it clanked loudly as it rolled across the hardwood floors. She HAD lost her dog, the best friend she ever HAD, but she HAD found the dog roaming near her home...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tired-verb problem occurs in most of the prose poems, though I think could be fixed relatively simply (though not necessarily quickly).\r\n\r\nThe Bellocq section isnât as compelling as the rest of the manuscript, but includes wonderful images and lines that I would hate to lose (such as the âblank pageâ repetition of the child reading dadâs secret scrapbook).\r\n\r\nThe manuscript also employs interesting repetition, in ways that both stress and emphasize its lines.

For example, the way he torques simile in the poem âthe endâ on page 8 (though this piece does still fall into the trap of codifying the female body):\r\n\r\nLike a cockâs comb along her cheekbones.

Unfortunately, I canât recommend it for NeWest.\r\nThe (almost) 21  plays surviving from the 130 that Plautus is thought to have written are the earliest surviving Latin literature.  Very little is known about Plautusâ life, even his real name: Plautus was a pseudonym for âFlatfootââapparently after the big shoes clowns wore.  But what is known is promising.    Plautus (254-184 B.C.)  lived during Romeâs struggle  with Carthage, which laid the foundation for Roman expansion and âcompletely transformed the social and economic life of Italyâ (Dudley, Roman Society, p..77).   It is thought that he was a soldier, and subsequently a shipowner who went bankrupt (...âwe have a blank for our authorâ âHenderson, A Plautus Reader ).  His prose was notable for its creativity and wit.  Nobody knows how he mastered Greek so thoroughly that he was able to adapt many, perhaps most, of his plays from the Greek âNew Comedyâ  (Menander, not Aristophanes et al. ) So the author had, in effect, a free hand.  So the author had, in effect, a free hand.  Not only that, he is evidently a considerable scholar and a gifted playwright (he  is or was the head of the drama dept. at the U of Calgary, has published many plays, and has written a book called The Ancient Comedians, and What They Have to Say to Contemporary Playwrights,  which I found really enjoyable and interesting).\r\n\r\nBut.\r\n\r\nThe danger in writing about  Plautus by having the protagonist narrate the story  in the first person is similar to the danger of a novel about Shakespeare or Moliere, or even (say) T.S. Eliot, in the first person. That is, the author needs to write exceptionally well, well enough to allow us to believe that itâs really the Great Writer talking to us.  I think Anthony Burgess pulled it off in Nothing Like the Sun, his take on the connection between Shakespeareâs love life and his art, but itâs a rare feat. We know that Plautusâ Latin is considered by those capable of judging (caveat: Iâm definitely not one of them) to be âsuch a thrill, that you just have to get into the idioms and rhythms...the things he talks about and the way he talks both throw out plenty of challenging colloquial terms and patter; and he mixes up a daring brew of mock Latin verse, with riotously ebullient verbal fireworks, a barrage of witticisms all the way from shrewd to crude, via smart punning and groansome funningâ  (Henderson, John, A Plautus Reader ).  Martini himself describes Plautusâ writing as âexuberantly comicâ.  But Iâd call Martiniâs prose and dialogue just ...well, workmanlike.  I donât recall a single pun, or anything that could be described as verbal fireworks.  There is some cynical wit, but no yuks and even no âgroanersâ ânothing over-the-top.  It might have been better to use the old device of the dogsbody or disciple as narrator, employed by Robert Graves and Gore Vidal in several of their novels, and by John Gardner (the narrator âPeekerâ)  in The Wreckage of Agathon\r\n\r\nRather, Plautus comes across as a somewhat raffish but hardworking and earnest craftsman, living from hand to mouth, and pursued by loan sharks ( an OK choice, but not a necessary one: Martini himself quotes a recent historian for the proposition that âancient theatre was wildly popularâ, and says specifically that Plautus was âimmensely popularâ, so had the author chosen, Plautus could plausibly have been quite a bit better off and thus a little more upmarket.)  Which leads me to the plot.  Itâs all about Plautusâ (ultimately successful) attempt to write and stage  a new play, which turns out to be The Captives .  âThatâs it?â, I thought at p.509.  I suppose the writing and staging of plays is what the author knows , but I was looking for more. Hannibal! Scipio Africanus! Cato the Elder!  The way Republican Rome functioned!  Roman slavery! (The last a curious failure, since the theme of The Captives  is precisely Roman slavery; cf. â The Captivi and the Paradoxes of Postliminium â , in Leigh, M. , Comedy and the Rise of Rome )These aspects of Roman history are not brought vividly to life but sort of interspersed as potted versions of Roman historyâi.e., anonymous drunken old guy ranting about the decline of Roman mores.(However, the author was  quite successful, I thought,  in describing how Rome, or at least its lower echelons,  looked and smelled. But somehow it didnât hang together and one didnât get the feeling that one looks for in a historical novel ---i.e., this is just what it must have been like.\r\n\r\nSome minor but annoying points: a glossary and a map of Rome, perhaps some illustrative sketches, and maybe even a brief introduction setting the historical context and containing some of that potted history (rather than introducing it in digressions) would have been helpful. After all, most readers have forgotten what little Roman history they ever knew, and very few will be familiar with ancient comedy For example, unless you know a lot about the chronology of Plautusâ plays, and when Cato the Elder brought Ennius to Rome, and when Naevius got in trouble with Romeâs heavy hitters, it will take awhile before you can guess that the play is set in 204 B.C.     I must say that I found the romantic subplots rather tedious. Plautus is more or less adopted by Casina, the omnicompetent madam of a Roman brothel who saves him from the depredations of a loan shark and bankrolls him. Watching the subplot unfold that ultimately lands them in bed together is like getting hit by a slow-motion punch. âCasinaâ, by the way, is the name of the eponymous heroine of Plautusâ last play, a sixteen-year-old girl who is the object of the competing lusts of a father and son; I guess that was a little joke for the cognoscenti. \r\n\r\nI suppose Iâm spoiled or perhaps prejudiced by how much I enjoy, among others, Robert Graves and Gore Vidal ---I was looking for something quite different.   In fairness, however, if in addition to adding the apparatus Iâve suggested, this novel were cut substantially and clearly positioned specifically as a novel about the writing and staging of a play---or perhaps if it were redrafted as a play, sort of a classical version of Noises Off?---it might be   diverting.  After you read I, Claudius or Belisarius or Wife to Mr. Milton, or Julian or Burr or Creation, youâll probably feel compelled to check out the history texts.  This novel  didnât inspire me to want to read Plautus, of whom Iâd read very little and that too long ago (though I did read a number of plays, just in case I was being unfair), but with a good deal of editing and cutting and some rewriting, perhaps it might.\r\n\r\n'),(508,29,476,2,2,1,'2015-11-23','2015-11-09',NULL,' NeWest has published a collection of short plays by Clem Martini, entitled Martini with a Twist (2012).

Iâm afraid, though, that I find myself a bit lukewarm to it.\r\n	The main strengths of the text are its commitment to experimentalism and its overarching throughline. The concept of labyrinthitis itself as a guiding metaphor and malady is a good one. I appreciate the tight sections of the text (the parallel lines, the focus on the lab- and âating words), which give a sort of pounding rhythm to the reading. The concept of the ear â as a hearing, sensing, and stabilizing organ â brings this all together under the sign and influence of bp and Borges. The cut-up, obviously indebted to Brion Gysin, also provides a neat structuring element.\r\n	My big resistance to the text comes when I consider it from the perspective of gender. This is, of course, not the writerâs fault â but NeWest needs to be thinking clearly and carefully about it as we seek to launch this new poetry line. I find that Brauneâs text is needlessly masculine, and it comes through in surprising ways in the text. Part of it is dictated by the constraints of the text: a word like labia was bound to be there.

Gertrude Stein gets a poem, but it seems almost an afterthought. A text that is guided by the usual masculine influences on experimentalism is, alas, likely to replicate the same gendered norms. Can we invite the author to think more about gender? I think that Woolf could enter here at a minimum, somehow â but Iâd like to push back and ask that the poet think about gender throughout and thoroughly. The language and word choices, the assemblages, strike me as sending not quite the right message right now.\r\n	In short, I see the strengths of this manuscript, absolutely.

We learn the story of Pete, the male protagonist, through parallel narratives from two periods in his life: at age 17 and at age 28. Although too young to be suffering from a mid-life crisis (and never obviously experiencing a coming of age), Pete definitely undergoes internal crisis over the apparent direction (or lack thereof) of his life. His issues? He never managed to escape Thunder Bay or became a rock star, even though his best friend from high school and former band mate managed to do both.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with this story is that itâs nearly impossible to sympathize with Pete. His experiences both as a teen and as a relatively new high-school teacher, as they are described, are unremarkable. The manuscript itself is also unremarkable: for an almost exclusively plot-driven and non-literary narrative, the plot isnât particularly compelling. Even the events that are supposed to be shockingâfor example, Pete discovering that his girlfriend is sleeping with his art teacher, or the impending return of his crush to Thunder Bay, or the progression of his illicit affairâare foreshadowed excessively, so Peteâs disclosure of them to the reader lacks impact.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, potential in this manuscript. If some of the relationships were better developed, and if some of the events werenât so obviously spelled out, there would be more room for the reader to breathe.'),(513,24,467,1,3,1,'2016-01-12','2016-01-04',NULL,'A novel, but with many lacunae (as poetry is wont to do). There are some compelling moments, especially in both the love affairs of Isabella, one of which hurts her husband but his love is strong, many of which are between her & her daughter. But the telling is rather prosaic (plonky in places), & sometimes I feel her word choices are a bit off (thus the suggestion that it would need some substantive editing. Yes, the story of the family moves from Italy (circa post-WW2) to the prairies, but there is little to really re/present the new place, just references to winter & cold. I am not really sure this is an exciting enough work for us to take it, but I think it should get a second reading, maybe from Jenna, to see if my hesitation is shared.'),(514,24,485,1,3,2,'2016-01-12','2016-01-04',NULL,'Well, if we were to take it, some fairly substantive perhaps. A lot of somewhat surreal/phantasmagorical pieces, finally perhaps too many (at one point I was really wishing I could get to the end more quickly); personae poems, I guess you could call them -- the \'I\' a fiction changing from poem to poem (& the \'you\'); the poems are almost all finished, reaching a period, a solid conclusion, no openings out from them. Too much heavy closure. Then toward the end, some pieces that held my attention more. Still, I would want to cut a lot of the pieces that seem to be doing much the same thing. In the end, I didnt feel that this was a volume of sufficiently interesting/engaging poems for us to take it on. Perhaps another reader might see it differently?'),(515,24,495,1,2,1,'2016-01-25','2016-01-19',NULL,'This is a BIG ms, full of poems ranging all over the place. What the writer says about it sounds interesting, & could be. It seems not quite as implied. The poems do cover a lot of those themes mentioned, but not always clearly, although always straightforwardly. Thereâs a didacticism to it all (not that I disagree with what seems to be the politics at work here), which settles into a kind of sentence structure that feels, too often, too plain, lacking nuance. Iâm not taken by a lot of it in the sense that I feel a desire to return to feel some depth. There are some good lines, but.\r\nAnother problem has to do with organization; a number of poems seem connected, but theyâre separated, there seems to be no real order to the ms, as it slips from first person memories (seeming like personal to the author) to tales about others, including parents, to personae poems, to arguments, but itâs just one after another, where I can see that if organized into thematic groups, there might be more accumulation of intent, interest.\r\nMaybe it just seems too âaccessible.â\r\nThen there are the typos, the grammatical problems here & there, & the shifts hither & yon from single spacing to one-&-a-half, as if he has just gathered separate page-files & shoved them all together. And the images, sometimes, reaching but not achieving quite: âunder a thick butter of starsâ for example, & many more. Iâm not sure what exactly many of them are trying to do, but that they try, perhaps too hard (too âsurreallyâ) is clear.\r\nAnd I cant take seriously someone who cares so little for his on poetry to let a line like this slip through:â lobbed like dud grenades over the my parents garden fence.â\r\nThere are stories here, mainly ones of family, fathers & sons, etc. But I too easily found myself skipping lines. The language, though smart enough, did not hold me (in other words, too much read like prose [in, say, a memoir] in which I could figure out the sense of what was being said & move quickly on).\r\nMuch of which could be fixed with an editor, but Iâm not really that interested, myself. In fact, as I read on, & finally gave up, I realized I just cant see letting this out under the NeWest imprint.

Itâs a kind of mashup of myth, history, & autobiography, in which figures from ancient myth, history, modern art & music, all meet & greet one another in poem after poem. Most of the poems are in traditional fairly long lines (he may be trying to work with conventional blank verse forms; some of the more interesting are in shorter lines), but since he writes also in fairly straightforward, if often complex, sentences, I found the poems generally not that exciting. I see that many have been published in various little mags, but suspect that when on their own, they don\'t build up the kind of boredom-of-form that I began to feel. I don\'t think itâs a good sign that I really had to push myself to return to the ms after I had to leave off overnight. There are some that felt pretty good, but my overall sense was of not wanting to re-read, & I have pretty well forgotten them all already. The one on the 15 Shostakovich string quartets listened to on the banks of the North Saskatchewan, which was in prose fragments, remains memorable. But these are little stories, mostly, & their lack of rhythmic intensity leads me to feel theyâd be just as interesting (or not) laid out as prose.

Well, they tend to the trad lyric with an âIâ that speaks, of or to certain events, situations, etc. mostly short line, fairly effective rhythmically, cover a lot of ground, but circle the sense of artistic (or aesthetic) perception of the world. The poems seek closure & find it, usually within a page. So some seem to be autobiographical while others utilize the âIâ so make statements not necessarily tied to the authorâs person.\r\nThe writer is a visual artist, & that shows in her imagery. There are some surreal dream poems. \r\nThereâs nothing wring with these poems, but nothing extraordinary about them either.\r\nI think another reader should take a look, but Iâm not as excited about this ms as I would wish to be about something we want to publish.\r\n'),(518,25,472,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(519,24,473,2,4,2,'2016-02-04','2016-02-03',NULL,'Well, this is impressive.

As the narrator tells the story, elements of a number of genres slip in & out of the writing, & Wilmot shows himself a master of their conventions, playing with & plying them in the service of a creepily sly subversion of all. What are readers to believe? Who are they to believe is this blog writers (& here, wittily, both the implied readers within the novel & the readers of it are implicated). How much of what the narrator writes are they to believe (all those bodies skinned: can they be ârealâ?). Wilmot certainly held my attention as M___ laid out the whole relationship as understood by M___, but what really is M___âs POV? Only near the end, does M___ begin to come clean about what the relationship really was, that is, how M___ & D___ really interacted rather than the series of interactions M___ has written out through the previous 200 pages; & yet, all those scripts are in a way âreal.â This is a truly different novel, a kind of horror-not-horror romance gone off the rails, but it gets a grip on a reader (well on this one) & with it also having an aspect of the Hollywood tell-all romantic fictions, it could catch a wide readership if it gets noticed properly.\r\nThere are some minor edits of language etc, but very small: itâs very clean & could go to press very quickly.\r\n'),(520,316,473,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(521,318,470,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(522,318,470,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(523,316,483,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(524,316,483,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(525,29,484,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL),(526,316,487,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-02-03',NULL,NULL);
